An interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how misinformation spreads across social networks, analyzed through different philosophical perspectives.

üåê **Live Demo**: [https://web-of-lies.vercel.app/](https://web-of-lies.vercel.app/)

## Overview

Web of Lies is an educational platform that simulates and visualizes the spread of misinformation in real-time. The project combines network visualization with philosophical analysis to help users understand how false information propagates and how different thinkers would interpret this phenomenon.

## Features

### Interactive Visualization
- Real-time network graph showing information spread
- Hierarchical visualization of how misinformation evolves
- Profile-based nodes with connection tracking
- Dynamic force-directed graph layout

### Multiple Misinformation Categories
- Health Misinformation
- Political Misinformation
- Technology Misinformation

### Philosophical Perspectives
The simulation includes analysis from various philosophers:
- **Neil Postman**: Media ecology perspective on how technology shapes information spread
- **Charles Peirce**: Pragmatic approach to truth and scientific methodology
- **C Thi Nguyen**: Analysis of echo chambers and epistemic bubbles
- **Sabina Leonelli**: Data-centric analysis of information spread
- **Ren√© Descartes**: Methodological skepticism applied to modern misinformation

### Interactive Controls
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Start/Pause/Reset functionality
- Category selection
- Philosophical lens switching
- Real-time statistics tracking

### Live Feed
- Real-time tweet display
- Engagement metrics
- Philosophical analysis of individual posts
- Visual tracking of information evolution

## How to Use

1. Select a misinformation category (Health, Politics, or Technology)
2. Choose a philosophical perspective to analyze the spread
3. Click "Start" to begin the simulation
4. Watch how information spreads through the network
5. Click "View Analysis" on any tweet to see philosophical commentary
6. Use the speed slider to adjust the simulation pace
7. Pause or reset the simulation as needed

## Educational Value

This tool is designed to:
- Demonstrate how misinformation spreads in digital networks
- Show different patterns of information propagation
- Provide philosophical perspectives on truth and knowledge
- Help users understand echo chambers and information bubbles
- Illustrate the speed and scale of misinformation spread
